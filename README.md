# Hypothesis testing for equivalence with matlab
Matlab implementation of equivalence tests

In the literature, there are several works and researchers, who use statistical equivalence and non-inferior tests in a wrong way, see:
Esteban Walker and Amy S. Nowacki: *Understanding Equivalence and Noninferiority Testing* (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019319/. )


To this end, in R, the library EQUIVNONINF (https://rdrr.io/cran/EQUIVNONINF/) provides great functions for equivalence testing.

In this repository, you may find the Matlab implementation some of these tests. I needed them for my research work. 
Thank you for your feedbacks!
