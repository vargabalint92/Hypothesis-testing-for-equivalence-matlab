Matlab implementation of equivalence test

In the literature, there are several works and reseachers, who use statistical equivalence and non-inferiory tests in a wrong way, see:
Understanding Equivalence and Noninferiority Testing (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019319/. )


To this end, in R the library EQUIVNONINF provides great functions for equivalence testting.

In this respository, you may find the matlab implementation some of these tests. I needed them for my research work. 
Thank you for your feedbacks!
